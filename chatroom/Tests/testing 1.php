The History of Hong Kong, a business port located off the south-east coast of China. Archaeological findings suggest that the region has been inhabited since the Old Stone Age, and later with its loose incorporation into the Chinese empire during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). Starting out as a farming fishing village and salt production site, Hong Kong later evolved into an important free port and eventually a major international financial centre.[1]!";
